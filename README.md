Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that apply engineering principles to design, develop, test, deployment and maintenance of software that solves real world problems. Software engineering involves the uses of the structured methodologies, processes and best practices to create reliable, efficient and scalable software applications and systems 
Importance of Software Engineering in the Tech industry
•	Quality assurance: Software engineering practices ensures that the software is reliable, efficient and free from bias or defects. Quality assurance of software is critical in finance, healthcare and aviation. 
•	Scalability: Software can handle or can be scaled to handle huge load of works without affecting much performance.
•	User satisfaction: A properly engineered software product should meets the user needs and expectations which can lead to higher user satisfaction  
•	Maintainability: Software engineering practices ensure that software is easy to maintain and update, which is crucial for long-term projects.
•	Security: Security is the cornerstone of tech industry and luck enough that the software engineering ensures best practices are used to ensure software is secure and protects the user data. 
•	Innovation: Software engineering creates a platform on which new ideas can be tested and implemented efficiently. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The evolution of software engineering has been characterized by key milestones in how the field has developed. The following below are the major events or milestones that have occurred:
The birth of software engineering 
The term software engineering was coined in the year (1968-1969) as the inception of software engineering as distinctive field at the NATO software engineering conference. During this stage, software failed to meet user requirements, the projects were not efficient and they went beyond schedule.
This stage they emphasized the need for better methodologies and best practices in software development.

 The rise of structured programming
 In the early 1970s, structured programming was on the rise and presented a shift in how software was to be developed. This stage introduced well defined control structures such as sequences and iterations which replaced unstructured programming. This led to readability, maintainability, and the ability to reason about the code. As a result of this best practice for programming was laydown. 
The Agile movement 
The early 2000s marked the turning point in software development methodologies. Before agile methodologies, waterfall model was the dominant approach. However this waterfall method was criticized for being inflexible and slow to adopt to change.
The agile proposed new set of values and principles that prioritized the following:
•	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
•	Working software over comprehensive documentation
•	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
•	Responding to change over following a plan
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emphasize iterative development, frequent collaboration, and customer feedback. This approach allows teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements, deliver working software frequently, and improve customer satisfaction.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for developing high-quality software efficiently. It consists of the following key phases:
Planning
This phase involves identifying the project scope, objectives, requirements, and feasibility. During this process, a software development plan is created.

Requirement Analysis
The stakeholders define functional and non-functional requirements and developers gather and document software expectations. During this stage the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document is created.

Design 
Designers and developers create software architecture and design models.

Implementation (Coding & Development)
This stage is the development and building of the program. Coding happens here. Software engineers write code based on the design specifications.
Code is tested at the unit level to ensure functionality.

Testing
Types of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
The testing is to ensure the software meets the specified requirements and functions correctly.

Deployment
The software is released to users in a production environment and the software is monitored for performance and security.

Maintenance & Support
At this stage there are updates, bug fixes, and security patches are provided as needed.
Software is optimized to improve performance and user experience and new features may be added based on user feedback and evolving requirements.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
•	Waterfall model is sequential and linear while agile methodology is iterative and incremental
•	Waterfall model is rigid with fixed phases while agile flexible allowing changes at any stage
•	Waterfall model have extensive and detailed documentation while agile have lightweight and adaptive
•	In Waterfall model testing is performed after development is completely while agile methodology testing is throughout the process.
•	In waterfall, a full product is delivered at the end while in agile methodology there are frequent releases. 
•	Waterfall model have minimal customer involvement after requirement gathering while agile methodology there is continuous involvement of customer throughout development.

Waterfall Model is best for structured, well-defined projects and is applicable in developing a banking system where strict compliance, documentation and security is required 

Agile methodology is best suited for dynamic apps and evolving projects. It’s applicable for developing a mobile app where user feedback is crucial for updates and improvements.
